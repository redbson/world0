# Changelog

All notable changes to World 0 are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **External-agent consultations** — read-only consultations with the
  system-installed `claude` and `codex` CLIs, each run in an isolated
  per-problem workspace. Exposed as `PKMAgent.consult_external_agent`, the
  `consult_claude_code` / `consult_codex` agent tools, `/claude` and `/codex`
  commands, and `claude` / `codex` CLI subcommands. Provider aliases
  (`claude` → anthropic, `codex` → openai) flow through model detection,
  the web status endpoint, and CLI/GUI provider options.
- **Real-LLM extraction-quality test suite** (`tests/test_extraction_quality_llm.py`)
  — end-to-end `text → ConceptNode` quality checks (synonym/acronym dedup,
  generic-noise filtering, relation direction, domain-sense split,
  contradiction handling, Chinese language preservation, cross-text identity).
  Skips automatically when no LLM provider is configured.
- **Color-field dynamics** — community-born color diffusion over the relation
  graph (`dynamics/color_diffusion.py`, `dynamics/community.py`,
  `communities/`).
- **Spaces** — isolated concept worlds with their own stores and sessions.
- **Source library** — raw-source provenance layer decoupled from extracted
  concepts (`sources/`, `schemas/source.py`).
- **Network-entropy metrics** — structural diagnostics of conceptual
  attention concentration (`metrics/entropy.py`).
- **Per-operation model configuration** and a configurable prompt registry
  (`models/`, `prompts/`).

### Changed
- **Relations** now use a three-axis model (positive / negative / parallel)
  with a deterministic semantic-relation → structural/propagation mapping.
- **World** internals split into a modular `world/` package
  (facade + ingest/reflect/status pipelines) backed by Protocol-satisfying
  engines.
- **Concept identity** resolved via semantic identity keys and
  signature-based consolidation (sense-aware dedup and merge/split ops).

### Fixed
- `IngestResult` now reports endpoint disconfirmation: when a contradicted
  relation has no existing edge, the weakened endpoint concepts are recorded
  in `weakened_concepts` instead of being applied silently.

## [0.2.0]

- Strengthen World 0 as a configurable concept system.

## [0.1.0]

- Initial World 0 concept-world agent.
